# Dominus

## Developing on Dominus

### Requirements

- [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org): To run the project.
- [`PostgreSQL`](https://postgresql.org): To store persistent data.

## Self Hosting

We do not support the idea of self hosting Dominus as we put a very high priority of providing the best experience for our end-users. If Dominus is lacking a feature you'd like to see, please refer to the developing guidelines above and if you can add that feature it will be in Dominus to stay.

Furthermore, Dominus has not been built with the idea of self hosting in mind and he makes use of many services that you will need to maintain in a production environment for full functionality. For example

- Dominus uses [`PostgreSQL`](https://postgresql.org) as his database.

All this said, if you really want to self host Dominus please take heed, he **_will absolutely not_** run on services such as [`Glitch`](https://glitch.com) or [`Heroku`](https://heroku.com). You **_will need_** a VPS (Virtual Private Server).

Sidenote, if you really think you're clever enough to self host then you're probably also smart enough to write your own bot.
